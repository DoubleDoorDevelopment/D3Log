Huge thanks to [Prism](https://github.com/prism) for making there plugin open source.

BE WARNED

** THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS. **

It is currently in highly experimental state, and should not be your only line of defence.

The database structure can be changed at any time without warning or opportunity to convert your data.
(Though that should happen, but it may!)
