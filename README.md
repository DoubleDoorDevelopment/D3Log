D3Log
=====

A Forge based logging mod.

Huge thanks to [Prism](https://github.com/prism) for making their plugin open source.
Our inner workings and database structure are largely based on their work.

BE WARNED

** THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS. **

It is currently in highly experimental state, and should not be your only line of defence.

The database structure can be changed at any time without warning or opportunity to convert your data.
(Though that should happen, but it may!)
